To run the program, please open the solve_sudoku.py. Modify the puzzle_name in that file to yours. Also please notice that if you want to solve a new puzzle without its .cnf file, please first open the sudoku2cnf.py file and change the puzzle_name in that file to yours. sudoku2cnf.py will then generate the .cnf file of your given .sud file automatically and so you can continue solve_sudoku.py with that generated .cnf file.
